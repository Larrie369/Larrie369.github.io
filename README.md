# Musician multitool

Musician multitool is a web application for musicians, that consist of 4 different tools - musical instrument tuner, learn fretboard tool for guitar and bass guitar, simple metronome and synth keyboard.

Application is created using JS, HTML and CSS. For microphone setup I've used Web Audio API and synth keyboard is created using AudioSynth https://github.com/keithwhor/audiosynth.

Calculation of the frequency of the sound from the microphone is provided using FFT and AutoCorrelation.

Learn fretboard tool is tool created to help beginner musicians with practising notes on the fretboard of their instrument.
This tool was the initial idea for creating this project, other features got added additionaly.
